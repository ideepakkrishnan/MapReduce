Execution Instructions
-----------------------------------------------

-------------
Local Machine
------------- 
(Pre-requisites: 
   - You have configured hadoop in your machine
   - You must have a HDFS file system running in your machine)

1. Create the required directory structure inside HDFS through the following commands
   - hdfs dfs -mkdir /climateTimeSeries
   - hdfs dfs -mkdir /climateTimeSeries/input
2. Go to your local folder where you have stored the input files
3. Copy the input files from your local file system into HDFS file system
   - hdfs fs -put some-file-name /climateTimeSeries/input
4. Execute the temperature time series program using following commands (without the quotes):
   - make alone
5. To see the generated files, run:
   - hdfs fs -ls /climateAnalysis/output
6. To see the contents of a generated file, run:
   - hdfs fs -cat /climateAnalysis/output/part-r-00000

-----
 AWS
-----
1. Open AWS S3 web UI and create a bucket with the following folder structure:
   - your-bucket-name/input
   - your-bucket-name/logs
2. Upload your input files into AWS using the following command:
   - aws s3 cp input-file-path s3://my-bucket/input/
3. Update your bucket name, input and output folder paths in the MakeFile for this project
4. Assuming that you have configured AWS CLI in your machine, use the following command to execute your program in AWS:
   - make cloud
5. After successfull termination of your EMR instance, you may copy the generated output to your local machine using:
   - mkdir output
   - aws s3 sync s3://your-bucket-name/output output
   - mkdir logs
   - aws s3 sync s3://your-bucket-name/logs logs
6. To delete your files from S3, use the following command:
   - aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket-name/output/ --recursive
   - aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket-name/input/ --recursive
   - aws s3 rm s3://your-bucket-name/logs/ --recursive
